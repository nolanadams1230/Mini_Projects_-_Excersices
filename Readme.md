## Inferential Statistics Exercises

### Examing Human Body Temperature
In this excersie I analyzed a dataset of human body temperatures and employ the concepts of hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and statistical significance.

### Examining Racial Discrimination
I performed a statistical analysis to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.

### Reducing Hospital Readmissions
In this excersie I critiqued a preliminary analysis of data and recommendations for reducing the readmissions rate and then constructed a statistically sound analysis and made recommendations of your own.

## Machine Learning

### Linear Regression - Predicting Boston Housing Prices
In this project we perform EDA on linear relationships on a Boston housing data set, make a linear regression model to predict housing prices, compare our models, and then evaluate the best model via model assumptions and other issues.

### Logistic Regression - Classification of Heights and Weights
Classifying gender based on heights and weights.

### Clustering - Marketing Newsletter
I use use K-Means clustering to help with some of the exploratory aspects of customer segmentation.

### Naive Bayes - Movie Reviews
In this project we perform a text analysis using a subset of movie reviews from the rotten tomatoes database. I use a fundamental technique in Bayesian inference

[Jupyter Notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nolanadams1230/Mini_Projects_and_Exercises/blob/master/Naive%20Bayes%20-%20Movie%20Reviews/Mini_Project_Naive_Bayes.ipynb)

## Data Science at Scale

#### Map Reduce with Spark
This excersice is focused on the fundamentals of Spark, the most popular tool used today to build Data Science distributed applications at scale. We use Spark in Python (via PySpark), including go over concepts such as Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs), algorithms such as MapReduce, and use Sparkâ€™s MLlib library to scale machine learning applications.

## JSON Project
In this excersie I used packages for dealing with JSON, study examples with JSON strings and files, and work on JSON strings and files.
